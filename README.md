# Scheduling Manufacturing Facility

This project is part of the Production Planning and Inventory Planning course (INDE 431) at the American University of Beirut. The project involves the task of efficiently managing worker schedules in a manufacturing facility.

This process involves taking into account various factors, including worker shift preferences, different worker categories (such as Senior Associates, Junior Workers, and Senior Workers), and the specific shifts that need to be covered on weekdays and weekends. The main goal is to create a well-balanced schedule that evenly distributes the workload among workers while ensuring that constraints. Additionally, it is essential to ensure that each worker is assigned to only one shift per day. 

This project explores the complexities of scheduling for both shorter time periods (e.g., the first quarter of 2021) and an entire year (2021) to optimize worker allocation and facility operations
